Coding makes my life easier.

This is a factory contains many little programs.

There are plugins like automatically pack memo on Evernote: [PackMemo](https://github.com/littlecodersh/EasierLife/wiki/1.0.2-PackMemo)

Make output of command line not to disturb the input: [ChatLikeCMD](https://github.com/littlecodersh/EasierLife/wiki/0.0-ChatLikeCMD)

MysqlClient and Sqlite3Client to make you cooperate with dbs in a time-saving and easy way: [MysqlClient](https://github.com/littlecodersh/EasierLife/wiki/0.4-MysqlClient)

And other little toys, I hope they will help you like they did to me:)
